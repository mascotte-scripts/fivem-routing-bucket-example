# What are routing buckets?

_For those unaware or lazy to search, one can assign a player or entity to a routing bucket, and they will only see entities (and players) that belong to the same routing bucket. In addition to that, each routing bucket will have its own ‘world grid’ for determining population owners, so even if you have population enabled, you’ll notice nothing unusual at all when using routing buckets._
